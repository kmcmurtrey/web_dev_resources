# web_dev_resources

This is my project for Code Louisville's back-end PHP web development course. It's a website to display my favorite and most used resources while learning web development. It's written in PHP to connect to a MySQL database that stores the information about the resources. 

Basic features include:
<ol>
  <li>Main page displaying all the websites in the database.</li?
  <li>MySQL database to store the website data.</li>
  <li>Form to create and edit websites in the database.</li>
  <li>The ability to delete websites from the database.</li>
  <li>A category sidebar that calls different SQL queries to display different groups of websites.</li>
</ol>
    
Other features to implement include:
<ol>
  <li>Login functionality so multiple users can add/edit website list items.</li>
  <li>Way for users to select/like/vote for their favorite or most used resources.</li>
  <li>Sort websites based on different criteria (category, alphabetically, popularity).</li>
  <li>Pagination.</li>
  <li>Nicer display of items.</li>
  <li>Comment system for users to add comments on individual list items.</li>
</ol>
